This impact must be very well dimensioned so as not to frighten and cause irreversible incomprehension, that is, to make the user feel unable to follow the path of progressive and technical studies of the ecosystem. The presentation must be audiovisual to concentrate the largest amount of information in the shortest possible time. 

The idea is to give the user a very quick and superficial overview of all the possibilities that the market offers:
