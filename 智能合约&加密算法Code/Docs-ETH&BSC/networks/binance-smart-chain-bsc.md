# Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\)

## **Why ?**

To be honest, it’s a no brainer. In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? While BSC might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Binance’s ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future. Sure, launching on Ethereum would be the easiest thing to do and probably receive faster initial uptake, but we like a challenge and are betting on BSC’s future.

Faster, cheaper. **Sold.**

### **What makes** Think in Coin **different from every other “farm”?**

We’re here to have fun.

What does that mean exactly? We’re going to be trying new things, with a focus on gamification.
