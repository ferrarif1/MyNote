# The BBS Signature Scheme

This repository is home to multiple internet drafts around the BBS Signature scheme, detailed below:

## BBS Signature Scheme (Core Draft)

This draft defines the core operations, cryptographic structures and overall protocol for the BBS Signature scheme

* [Compare Drafts](https://decentralized-identity.github.io/bbs-signature)

## Blind Sign BBS Signature Scheme Extension

This draft defines an extension to core draft enabling the ability for blind bbs signatures, including describing the required operations, cryptographic structures and sub-protocol.

## Meetings

Regular meetings are held bi-weekly on Mondays, on the same weeks as the Applied Crypto Working Group call is held.

Meeting agendas and minutes can be found in [/meetings](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/bbs-signature/tree/main/meetings), the next up and coming meetings agenda can be found in [here](agenda.md).

## Tooling

To assist the development of the specification a set of tooling is co-located in this repository and can be found [here](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/bbs-signature/tree/main/tooling).

### Generating the output documents

The text and HTML versions of the specifications can be generated by running `make`; this requires having the [xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/) and [mmark](https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark) packages installed.
