# Binance Chain

## Intro <a id="intro"></a>

[Binance Chain](https://www.binance.org/) is a blockchain developed by [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) and its community that implements a vision of a decentralized exchange \(DEX\) for digital assets.

At the heart of Binance Chain is a highly performant [matching engine](https://docs.binance.org/guides/concepts/matching-engine.html) built on [distributed consensus](https://docs.binance.org/guides/concepts/architecture.html) that aims to replicate the &lt;1 second trading efficiency of current centralized exchanges.

Binance Chain transactions burns BNB \(the native token of the Binance ecosystem\), according to a fee schedule.

Binance Chain also includes efforts to implement [listing assets from other chains](https://docs.binance.org/atomic-swap.html), and cryptographic primitives such as [threshold signatures](https://docs.binance.org/guides/concepts/threshold-signature-scheme.html).

## Functionality <a id="functionality"></a>

Binance Chain has the basic features of most blockchains:

* Sending and receiving BNB and digital assets
* Issuing new digital assets \(we have a standard called BEP-2\)
* Mint/burn, freeze/unfreeze, lock/unlock of digital assets

It has DEX and trading-specific functionality:

* Propose exchange listing for trading pairs
* Creating maker/taker orders for traders
* Listing assets from other chains using atomic swaps \(BEP-3\)

Binance Chain also implements new features, such as

* Threshold Signatures \(an alternative to multisig\)
* Smart Contracts sidechain \(in-progress\)

## Participate <a id="participate"></a>

There are different ways to participate in the network, from light nodes to full validators.

Binance Chain follows a philosophy of progressive decentralization. We envision a future where organizations and individuals can run validator nodes, and BNB can be staked to join governance.
